# Punchclock
A Discord bot that allows staff to manually set their availability for a server, and let users see that list. This bot was inspired by a server that had a channel for marking staff as active (in the case of user statuses not being accurate) and I wanted to come up with a better solution.

## Commands:

### `clockin` or `ci`:
Allows you to mark yourself as available.

### `clockout` or `co`:
Allows you to mark yourself as unavailable.

### `seestaff` or `staff`
Provides a list of all staff who have marked themselves as available.
